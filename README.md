## About
Jaeger connector to Tempo

**Version 3 of this plugin is not compatible with Version 2**
Version 3 is written with OTEL specifications to make it interoperate better.

## Build/Compile
In order to compile the plugin from source code you can use `go build`:

```
cd /path/to/jaeger-objectstorage
go build ./cmd/jaeger-objectstorage
```

## Configuration
### Requirements
Use our fork of tempo [https://github.com/flitnetics/tempo](https://github.com/flitnetics/tempo)

To make it simpler, we have built a docker image for our tempo fork:
[https://github.com/flitnetics/tempo/pkgs/container/tempo](https://github.com/flitnetics/tempo/pkgs/container/tempo)

Expose ports for tempo image's container: 3200,4317,4318

Explanation: 
 tempo backend: 3200
 otel grpc: 4317
 otel http: 4318

We try to match to the same stable version from upstream tempo with our own modifications.

## Backend Configuration
This file is placed in your plugin's directory (see the next section to understand more).

```config.yaml
backend: your.tempo.backend:3200
```

## Running Jaeger with Object Storage Plugin
In the same directory that you had compiled jaeger-objectstorage with `config.yaml` located, run:

```
docker run --name jaeger -it -e SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=grpc-plugin \                             
  -e GRPC_STORAGE_PLUGIN_BINARY="/app/jaeger-objectstorage" \
  -e GRPC_STORAGE_PLUGIN_CONFIGURATION_FILE=/app/config.yml \
  -e GRPC_STORAGE_PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 9411:9411  \

```

## Testing with Jaeger Example HotROD application
```
docker run \                                                                                                          2 â†µ
  --rm \
  --link jaeger -e JAEGER_AGENT_HOST="jaeger" \
  --env OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://<tempo backend ip or host>:4318 \
